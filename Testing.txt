Jest:

Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that is commonly used for testing JavaScript code, including both front-end and back-end applications.
It is developed by Facebook and is widely used for testing React applications, but it can be used for any JavaScript project.
Jest provides a test runner, assertion library, and mocking support out of the box.
It is known for its simplicity, speed, and ability to run tests in parallel.
SuperTest:

SuperTest is a library for testing HTTP assertions in JavaScript applications.
It is often used in conjunction with Jest or other testing frameworks to test the HTTP responses of a server.
SuperTest allows you to make HTTP requests to your server and then make assertions about the responses.
It provides a fluent API for making HTTP requests and inspecting the responses, making it easy to write expressive and readable tests.
